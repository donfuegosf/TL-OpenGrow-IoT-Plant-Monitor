# Web Application Structure

The OpenGrow web application can be divided into 3 parts which are each found within the 'src' folder:

1. MQTT Broker
1. Web-app front-end
1. Web-app back-end

## MQTT Broker

The MQTT Broker is built with the [aedes library](https://github.com/moscajs/aedes).

All the code for this barebone MQTT broker can be found in the src>mqtt-broker folder.

## Web-App Front-End

Front-end is built with React Js and bootstrapped with [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

All code for front-end is in src>client>src folder.

## Web-APP Back-End

Excluding contents of the afore-mentioned folders, all remaining code within the src folder is for the back-end.
